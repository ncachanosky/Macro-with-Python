**Macro with Python** uses typical topics covered in an Intermediate (or advanced) macroeconomics course to offer introductory examples to [Python](https://www.python.org/). The examples assume an introductiry knowledge of Python and same familiarity with intermediate macroeconomic models.

The examples are intended to learn to use Python in the context of macroeconomic models. The examples are not intended to offer complete discussion of the models or coding techniques. The intention of **Macro with Python** is to get started with **how** to use Python in macroeconomics. [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) offers more advanced an detailed documentation.

The **GitHub** repository of this project is located [here](https://github.com/ncachanosky/Macro-with-Python).


> **Macro with Python** is an ongoing project. More examples will be added as they become available.
> [Submission](https://github.com/ncachanosky/Macro-with-Python/issues) of issues and recommendations are welcome.


## Macro with Python: Notebooks

All notebooks make use of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

For an example on symbolic mathematics and LaTeX format, see **The Solow Model** (section 1). 

For examples of how to find the roots ([SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)) of a system of equations, see **The Labor Market** (section 3) and **The AD-AS Model** (sections 5 and 6). 

For a shooting algorithm, see **A Simple Ramsey Model** (section 5).
