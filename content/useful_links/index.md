## Where to get Python?

Probably the most user-friendly way to get [Python](https://www.python.org/) is through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), an environment that allows to easily download and update Python packages and extensions.

In addition to its applications, [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) also includes instructional videos and documents.

## Where to write Python code?

[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) comes with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and other options to code. Another popular tool is [JupyterLab notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). If you are familiar with R, Anaconda also comes with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).
