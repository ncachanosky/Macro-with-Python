**Macro with Python** uses topics typically covered in an Intermediate (or advanced) macroeconomics course to offer introductory examples to [Python](https://www.python.org/). The examples assume an introductiry knowledge of Python and same familiarity with intermediate macroeconomic models.

The examples are intended to learn to use Python in the context of macroeconomic models. The examples are not intended to offer complete discussion of the models or coding techniques. The intention of **Macro with Python** is to get started with **how** to use Python in macroeconomics. [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) offers more advanced an detailed documentation.
