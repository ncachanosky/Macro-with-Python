# WELCOME TO MACROECONOMICS WITH PYTHON

This website offers [Python](https://www.python.org/) applications of typical topics of intermediate and advanced courses in macroeconomics. The intention of these applications is to use macroeconomic topics as learning excercises on how to Python for macroeconomics.

The notes assumes familiarity with macroeconomics and a beginner or introductory familiarity with Python.

These notes are not intended to be a full explanation of macroeconomic models or to be a sample of best coding practices. They are intended to "get us" started with how to use Python for macroeconomics rather than developing advanced skills. The website [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) offers more advanced and detailed documentation.

The material is presented as [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Codes are written in [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) deployed through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/).

> Macroeconomics with Python is project in development. More material will be uploaded as it becomes available.
