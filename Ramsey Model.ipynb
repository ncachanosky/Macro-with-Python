    "A known issue with the Solow model is that the savings rate is exogenous (and constant). This means the ratio of consumption to income $Y/C$ is also constant. While the Solow model can be useful to highlight some features of long-run growth, this assumption also limits the applicability of this model. Yet, the Solow model can be interpreted as a specIal case of Ramsey model (or Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model). Ramsey model can be considered as the building block of macro models with a household that optimizes its utility and, therefore, endogenously sets the savings rate.\n",

    "This note presents a \"simple\" Ramsey model (it offers a simplified discussion, does not discuss shocks, and does not add other features). For a more complete and detailed discussion see an advanced macroeconomics textbook. \n",

    "The model is populated by a representative household that maximizes its utility and by a representative firm that maximizes its profits. The model assumes a competitive market (no monopoly power, agents are price takers, etc.) The household provides labor services to the firm in exchange of a wage. The wage can be used to consume goods or save and accumulate assets. The model assumes a closed economy with no government. Finally, the model is presented in continuous (rather than discrete) time. A \"dot\" on top of a variable denotes its instantaneous time-change $(\\dot x (t) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t})$"

Therefore, $L(t) = L(0) \\cdot e^{nt}$\n",

If $\\rho < 0$, then the present generation is altruistic and values the utility of the next generation more than their own.\n",

At some period in time, assets can be negative, which means that in that period the household has a net debt. Assets have a rate of return of $r$. Therefore, the stock of assets increase by the return of the assets plus wages, and decrease by the amount of consumption. Since population growths at rate $n$, the change in household's assets can be represented as follows.\n",

There is no opportunity to increase utility by moving consumption over time (extend a loan and postpone consumption or take a debt and advance consumption).

    "# 5. THE CODE\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code has the following structure. Following the above discussion, after importing the required packages and defining parameters and arrays, the equilibrium, gold values, and _loci_ lines are calculated. The code plots two graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first one shows the _loci_ lines with five sample paths (in red). Each one of these sample paths depicts the unstable dynamics of the model. The second graph plots the stable-path (in blue). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 ESTIMATING THE STABLE-PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to estimate the stable-path is with a \"shooting\" methodology. This approach shoots a number of paths until it finds one that is close enough the actual stable path. Let $\\tilde{k}$ and $\\tilde{c}$ denote estimated values of the path produced by the \"shooting\" algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This note uses a **simple** code and methodology to illustrate this type of numerical method. It is not intended to be the more efficient one. The stable path is estimated in two halves. One estimation for the stable path section to the left of the equilirium point, and another estimation for the stable path to the right of the equilibrium point. These two estimations are coded as two different functions: (1) backward shoot and (2) forward shoot respectively. Alternatively, one simple \"shoot\" function could include both initial locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "These type of iterations can be time consuming depending on how many shoots the code is going to perform (which depends on how big a correction is when a shoot misses the steady-state), what the tolerance level is, etc. A more sofisticated code could reduce the number of attempts and save computational time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that is very unlikely that our \"shoots\" will exactly hit the steady state $(k^*, c(k^*)$, we need to define a success criteria. The success criteria is when the shoots hits close enough to the target. We need to define circle around the equilibrium that plays the role of the tolerance level. Once we find a \"shoot\" that hits inside this circle, the shoots is considered a success and an approximation good enough for the estimation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance of a point to the steady-state is: $distance = \\sqrt[2]{(\\tilde{k} - k^*)^2 + (\\tilde{c} - c^*)^2}$, where $\\tilde{k}, \\tilde{c}$ are the shoot estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shooting functions have two inputs. The initial level of $k_0$ and a \"step\" size. The \"step\" size is how big the correction of the initial shoot will be after it misses the tolerance level (the target). Given $k_0$, the function estimates a level of $c(k_0)$ (the first shoot). If the shoot misses the target, then the algorithm performs a correction to the initial level of $c_0$ and shoots again. This sequence repeats until the shoot hits the target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.1 \"FORWARD\" SHOOT\n",
    "The first shoot of the forward shoot function is located one step below the _loci_ function. We know is very likely that this initial shoot is too high, and therefore the path will go above $c^*$. The loop has two break points to define a succesfull shoot. The first one is if the path produces a point $(k, c)$ inside the tolerance distance from the steady-state (the above discussion). The second one is the path produces a value of $\\tilde{k} > k_*$. This break point is in place because the step size (how far the new shoot starting point moves) is a fixed amount without a correction or feedback mechanism. It is possible, then, that after missing the target the next iteration starts at a value of $c$ that is too low. Such path may still be an estimation good enough even if it does not satisfy the tolerance level (for the purposes of this notebook, this is enough). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third break, which is a cap on the number of iterations the loop can perform. When building a code like this, this type of break can help avoid a mistake that sends the code into an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the path produces a value of $\\tilde{c} > c^*$, then the loop resets and starts again from a new initial $c_0$ that is located one \"step size\" below the previous shoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.2 \"BACKWARD\" SHOOT\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward shoot function follow a similar structure than the forward shoot. Yet, because the starting point is different, the break points have to be modified. However, there is a difference in the starting point. Rather than starting at the _loci_ level given the initial on step above $c_0 = c(k_0)$, the code starts with $c_0 = c(k_0)\\cdot 1.5$. This is an example of an easy way to save some computational power. Looking at the first figure (the unstable paths) we know that the level of consumption of the stable path will be several steps above $c(k_0)$. Therefore, we can save computation time by avoiding shoot attempts between $c(k_0)$ and $c(k_0)\\cdot 1.5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The forward shoot loop has two stop points of success. The first one is if the shoot produces a point inside the tolerance circle. The second one is if the path produces a value of $\\tilde{k} < k^*$ (for similar reasons than the forward shoot break). There is also the third break built on the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since the starting point is farther away from the equilibrium point, this break has a larger limit of iterations than the forward shoot loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the shoot produces a value of $\\tilde{c} < c^*$, then the code resets and calculates a new shoot with a new $c_0$ one step above the previous shoot."
